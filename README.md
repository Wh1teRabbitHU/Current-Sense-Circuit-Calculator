# Current monitor circuit calculator web application

If you want to make a circuit which can calculate current, voltage and power, then this small web application can be handy to calculate the limits of your components. Either you can use a single ADC or an OpAmp + ADC combo.

You can access the web application from [here](https://wh1terabbithu.github.io/current-monitor-circuit-calculator/)

The design part is under construction. ;-)
